## Notes

- **Real Data**: Uses actual Steam library files and Steam Web API
- **Windows Registry**: Reads Steam installation path from Windows Registry
- **File Permissions**: Requires read access to Steam installation directory
- **API Limits**: Steam Web API has rate limits (handled gracefully)
- **Fallback Data**: Uses popular games list when API is unavailable

## How It Works

### Library Detection
1. Reads Steam installation path from Windows Registry
2. Parses `libraryfolders.vdf` to find all Steam library locations
3. Reads `appmanifest_*.acf` files for each installed game
4. Extracts game details (App ID, name, size, installation path)


### Game Launching
1. Uses Steam protocol URLs (`steam://run/{appId}`)
2. Launches games through Steam client
3. Works with any Steam game or application
